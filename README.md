## Overview

**Project Title**: Godot/Rust game

**Project Description**: A game made with Godot and Rust

**Project Goals**: To satisfy the requirements of the Game Framework module and get a little more practice with Rust.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Install Rust: https://rustup.rs/
2. Install Godot: https://godotengine.org/download
3. Compile the Rust extension with `cargo build`
4. Open the Godot project in the Godot editor
5. Press the run button in the top right corner

Instructions for using the software:

1. Move with the arrow keys or WASD, jump with space.
2. If you fall off the platform, relaunch the game to reset.

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

Everything is standard git/Rust, except that the git hooks are stored in the `.githooks` directory. Run `git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks` when setting up a new environment.
