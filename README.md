#### Instructions

Install Rust: https://rustup.rs/

Install Godot: https://godotengine.org/download

Compile the Rust extension with `cargo build` (run within the rust directory).

Open the Godot project in the Godot editor and press the run button in the top right corner.

To play, move with the arrow keys or WASD and jump with space. If you fall off the platform, relaunch the game to reset.

#### Development Environment 

Note that the git hooks are stored in the `.githooks` directory. Run `git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks` when setting up a new environment.

#### Ideas for further development

* [ ] More movement options - grappling hook, dashing, etc.
* [ ] More stuff to explore
* [ ] An actual objective(?)
